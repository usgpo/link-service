# link-service

The Link Service is used to create links to content and metadata on GovInfo. This allows for both predictable link creation as well as the ability to point to the latest version of a given resource - like the latest version of a Congressional Bill or latest edition of a CFR section.

For more information, see the interactive documentation available at https://www.govinfo.gov/link-docs/ . This link service has been built and documented using the [Open API Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) and [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
